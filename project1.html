          <span class="py-3">
            The AEM migration project was a client-side project with a US based
            MNC - Travel + Leisure Co. for their RCI division which is a premier
            vacation exchange company. The current CMS of the company was a
            website where a user can sign up to buy a membership and then book
            vacations by choosing the desired resorts or hotels along with the
            option of modifying all activities and amenities that the user
            requires.

              <p>
                I worked as a UI developer in a team of 5 developers and 2 UX designers at Cognizant Technology and Solutions.

          <p class="text-justify pt-3">
            The CMS website of the business had its limitations of implementing
            functionalities which could give the user an upgraded experience on
            the website. Hence the migration to Adobe Experience Manager. 
            <br>
            But the authors of the business have been using the same website since
            quite a few years and are used to it, so it was decided, that the
            fields and overall design will be exactly like the preceding version,
            but with better functionalities.

      <div class="pt-4 font-weight-bold">UNDERSTANDING THE TASK</div>
        <div class="text-justify pt-3">
          The main motive of the development team was to transfer the existing website to AEM in a step-by-step migration process of :  
          <ol class="py-3">
            <li>Design</li>
            <li>Functionalities</li>
            <li>Content</li>
          </ol>
          After the completion of the above, move on to the security and deployment challenges and resolve them efficiently.

          <u>What did I do ?</u> 
          <ul class="ul py-3">
            <li class="pt-2">I started off by understanding the flow of the existing website in terms of the user journey beginning from the landing page , onto the searching of resorts/hotels/retreats, booking the desired stay with all the desired modifications in terms of activities and ending with checkout and payment.</li>
            <li class="pt-2">Before starting the development coding, I worked with the UI/UX designers of our clients who gave a detailed mockup of the design and user journey (using Invision as the design tool) which had to be implemented while migrating the website.</li>
            <li class="pt-2">In terms of coding I contributed to each component the development team made by using HTML, CSS, React JS and Node JS to implement the functionalities and design of the website. </li>
            <li class="pt-2">After the coding of each component I worked with the testers to fix all of the accessibility issues of the website so that it could also be used by people with impaired vision. </li>
            <li class="pt-2">I collaborated my work with the other developers of my team on BitBucket and updated the business team of the client via Jira and Confluence. </li>

          <ul class="ul py-3">
            <li class="pt-2">After each page was completed for the website I worked with the AEM team to make all the content accessible on the AEM platform and we got a completed version of re-usable AEM pages and components by using Adobeâ€™s recommended Sling Model framework so that it could be delivered to the client. </li>
            <li class="pt-2">As a result of our implemented solutions, the client achieved three things: automated deployments, a fully-automated process of source code releases and deployments; easy content management, established with a single point of access to manage the website; and an automated AEM framework for the author and publisher environments in AEM.</li>
